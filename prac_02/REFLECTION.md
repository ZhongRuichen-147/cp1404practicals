Write short but thoughtful answers to each of the following.  
Replace each `...` with your meaningful answer.

## What percentage of the lecture videos have you watched so far?

60%

## What time, location and duration have you scheduled to watch lecture videos?

Monday, Wednesday, Saturday at 7:30pm at my home, 60 minutes each time.

## What are you doing well in the subject so far that you will keep doing?

I start each practical early, follow the CP1404 coding structure, and push my work to GitHub regularly.

## What do you need to stop or change in your work for this subject overall so far?

I need to stop leaving tasks until the last minute and reduce distractions while studying (mobile phone).

## What are you currently doing poorly for practicals in this subject that you will change?

I sometimes jump into coding without planning and I don't always test enough different inputs. I will plan first and test edge cases.

## What are you doing really well for practicals in this subject?

I am using functions properly, writing clearer names, and using Git commits to track progress.
